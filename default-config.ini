; this is the IP that erebus has on the VPN; only used in openvpn-server static-key mode
client-ip = 10.8.0.2

; if this section exists, erebus will connect to an openvpn server
[openvpn-server]

; Valid values: udp, tcp. tcp is not recommended in order to avoid
; tcp-over-tcp problem, it should only be used in environments
; blocking UDP
proto = udp

; host and port of the vpn server.

; the key needs to be generated with `openvpn --genkey --secret static.key` and pre-shared.
; This is currently required as erebus only supports static key mode as of now.
; Like openvpn, you can specify a direction in there or in the separate "key-direction"
; parameter. If the direction is unspecified, both openvpn-server and erebus will use the
; same key for sending and receiving. If you wish to have 2 different keys for sending and
; receiving, make sure one side uses 0 and the other uses 1.

; Valid values:
; secret = /path/to/static.key
